# Homework 6 - Programming

## Problem 1 - 24 points
Programming Project P6.5 in *Big Java*.

(Note that a snapshot of this problem has been included in the file p6.5.png)

I have provided templates for the following files:

* `Nim.java`: This is the test class. *Do not modify it*.
* `Game.java`: This class should be completed by you.
* `Computer.java`: This class should be completed by you.
* `Human.java`: This class should be completed by you.

## Problem 2 - 23 points
Programming Project P8.7 in *Big Java*.

(Note that a snapshot of this problem has been included in the files p8.7.png)

This we I have provided a single template only, `ZipTest.java`. Your code *must* work with the ZipTest class I have provided. This means that you will need to create your own Zipcode class with the interface *implied* by ZipTest.java

## Problem 3 - 3 points

In addition to the source files for your programs include a single text file in your codio workspace named readMe.txt with an explanation of what you did for each programming problem. That is, write in plain English, instructions for using your software, explanations for how and why you chose to design your code the way you did. The readMe.txt file is also an opportunity for you to get partial credit when certain requirements of the assignment are not met.

### A word about Grading:
Each programming question on assignment will be graded as follows:

* 20% if it compiles
* 65% if it runs properly (expected output for given input, etc.)
* 5% for style (formatting of code, variable names, comments, etc. Use the style guide posted on Coursworks!)
* 10% for design (efficiency, class  organization, method length, etc...)

Please make sure your programs at least compile before you submit them! We will no longer be giving partial credit for programs that do not compile at all.
